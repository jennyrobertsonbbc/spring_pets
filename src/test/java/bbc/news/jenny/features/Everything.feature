Feature: The whole project works as expected

  Background:
    Given The databases processes table is cleared

#  Scenario: Inserting an item entry for a multi region product causes archive sitemap processes to be generated for both regions
#    When An item is inserted into the database for product "news"
#    Then A "archive" file relation for the region "UK" has been made for the item
#    And A "archive" file relation for the region "COM" has been made for the item
#    Then The processes table contains the items file ids

#  Scenario: Adding a new pet causes a new record for that pet to be added to the pets table
#    When An item is inserted into the database for product "news"
#    Then A "archive" file relation for the region "UK" has been made for the item
#    And A "archive" file relation for the region "COM" has been made for the item
#    Then The processes table contains the items file ids
